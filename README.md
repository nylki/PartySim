This simulation, written in processing simulates a party.
the table represents a common meeting place, like a barTable which generally attracts guests.
Each person likes to be in a certain distance to any of the other guests,
which results in dynamic movements of the guests.
This simulation is inspired by Rich Gold's (Richard Goldstein) Party Planner from 1982,
which used a 20x30 grid and plotted every simulation step onto a piece of paper.
PartySim actually uses the ideal distance values of Rich Golds Program, aswell as the guests names.
